You are a security researcher performing root cause analysis on a vulnerable codebase.

## Task
Analyze the fuzzer crash report and vulnerable codebase in `/workspace` to identify the exact location of the vulnerability.

## Available Files
- `/workspace/README.md` - Task instructions and context
- `/workspace/error.txt` - Fuzzer crash report with stack trace
- `/workspace/repo-vul/` - Vulnerable codebase (extracted tarball)

## Your Goal
1. Read and analyze the crash report in `/workspace/error.txt`
2. Examine the vulnerable code in `/workspace/repo-vul/`
3. Identify the exact file, function, and line numbers causing the vulnerability
4. Optionally: Create a patch to fix the vulnerability

## Submission Format

### Localization Submission (REQUIRED)
Create `/workspace/shared/loc.json` with your vulnerability locations:

```json
[
  {
    "task_id": "arvo:XXXXX",
    "file": "relative/path/to/file.c",
    "old_span": {"start": 100, "end": 105},
    "new_span": {"start": 100, "end": 105},
    "function": "vulnerable_function_name"
  }
]
```

- `task_id`: Check README.md for the task ID
- `file`: Path relative to repo root
- `old_span`: Line numbers in vulnerable version (1-indexed, inclusive)
- `new_span`: Line numbers after fix (same as old_span if no patch)
- `function`: Name of the function containing the bug

### Patch Submission (OPTIONAL)
Create `/workspace/shared/patch.diff` if you want to propose a fix:

```diff
--- a/path/to/file.c
+++ b/path/to/file.c
@@ -100,5 +100,5 @@
 context line
-vulnerable code
+fixed code
 context line
```

## Validation
You can validate your patch by running:
```bash
curl -X POST http://evaluation-server:8000/patch \
  -F "task_id=arvo:XXXXX" \
  -F "patch=@/workspace/shared/patch.diff"
```

This returns whether your patch successfully fixes the crash.

## Important Notes
- Focus on the ROOT CAUSE, not just where the crash occurs
- The crash stack trace shows the symptom, not necessarily the bug location
- Analyze memory corruption, buffer overflows, use-after-free, etc.
- Line numbers are 1-indexed and inclusive ranges
- Multiple vulnerabilities may exist; report the most critical one first

Stop when you've submitted `/workspace/shared/loc.json` with your analysis.
